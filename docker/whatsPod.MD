[What are Kubernetes Pods Anyway?](https://www.ianlewis.org/en/what-are-kubernetes-pods-anyway)

`You know why containers in a pod are always scheduled together? It's cuz they're nested containers.`

```
While it wasn't 100% accurate (Containers aren't really a thing. We'll get to that in a bit) it did point out the fact that Pods are amazing things. It's worth taking a look at Pods and containers in general and learn what they actually are.

The Kubernetes documentation on Pods provides the best and most complete explanation of Pods but it's written in a very general sense and uses a lot of jargon. I do recommend you read it though as it's a better and more correct explanation than I could write. This post will hopefully be a more down-to-earth compliment.
